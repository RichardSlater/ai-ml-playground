# Artificial Inteligence and Machine Learning playground
A playground for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, mostly experiments, possibly something more here and there.

## Terminology
Given I know next to nothing about this field, here is some terminology I have picked up along the way.  It's entirely possible that I have got something wrong, in which case I will not be offended if you reach out to me and point out my mistkaes:

 - **PSNR**: Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio is an expression for the ratio between the maximum possible value (power) of a signal and the power of distorting noise that affects the quality of its representation. <sup>[[1]][ni-psnr]</sup>
 - **Epoc**: The number of passes over the dataset to spend training the model.
